# Overview
Using digital tokens to represent 
track contributions
to open source software projects
and to
reward contributors
with influence 
and a share of the tips 
paid by happy users
could provide
a much more satisfying experience 
for contributors.

If materially successful,
this would result in an
explosion of productivity 
in the most valuable assets our society 
is currently capable of producing.

Because there are many ways 
tokens can be used with open source software
this document describes a type of utility token
that we will call a "tipping token."

# Uses
Tipping tokens, as defined in this document,
are only used to solve a very narrow set of problems
related to tracking the contributions
of volunteers.

## Contributions
When a volunteer contributes to
an open source project
they are issued tokens
as a reward.
The number of tokens issued
is proportional to the value of the contribution.

## Tips
Open source projects often
receive tips from happy users.
Tipping tokens are used to reward
contributors with tips in proportion
to their contributions.

This is accomplished because tipping tokens
are a specific type of utility token.
Open source projects that use tipping tokens
automatically purchase and consume those tokens
when a user provides a tip.

In this way owners of tipping tokens
are rewarded by trading their tokens
for tips.

## Influence
When a decision needs to be made
about the future direction of an open source project
it is obvious that past contributors
should be able to influence the decision
in proportion to the value of their contributions.

Traditionally this has been handled by a
"benevolent dictator." 
Primarily because the accounting involved 
has been too onerous for a volunteer effort.
Occasionally attempts are made to determine
relative influence based on number of check-ins 
or reputation,
but the former can be very deceptive
and he latter tends to greatly favor
recent contributors at the expense 
of older contributors.

Using tipping tokens a vote
can be held
to determine the direction of the project
in a more transparent and fair manner.

## Fundraising 

Tipping tokens are not used to fund
open source projects
but simply to reward volunteers
for contributing without upfront compensation.

Tipping tokens are never advertised to anyone
by the project contributors.

The software silently purchases tokens in the background
when tips are paid,
so there is no reason for the user
to know that the tokens exist.
